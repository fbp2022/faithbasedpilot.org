  <h1>What I Believe</h1>

  <main>
    <p><strong>About God</strong> I believe in one true God, eternally existent in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit—equal in power, glory, and essence. God is the Creator of all things, having spoken creation into existence from nothing. His sovereignty, holiness, and love reveal His character and purpose. (Genesis 1:1; Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19)</p>

    <p><strong>About the Bible</strong> The Bible is God’s inspired and authoritative Word—perfect, infallible, and complete. It is the foundation for faith, doctrine, and life. Through Scripture, God reveals His will, His plan of redemption, and His character. The Word of God takes precedence over any earthly law or authority that contradicts its truth. (2 Timothy 3:16–17; Psalm 119:105; Hebrews 4:12)</p>

    <p><strong>About the Holy Spirit</strong> The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the triune Godhead—equal with the Father and the Son. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment; indwells believers at salvation; and empowers them to live in holiness and serve God faithfully. He distributes spiritual gifts according to His will. The truest evidence of His presence is love expressed in action. All spiritual gifts remain active in the Church today and must be exercised with balance and biblical order. (John 14:16–17; John 16:8; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:4–11; Galatians 5:22–23)</p>

    <p><strong>About Mankind</strong> Humanity was created in God’s image with purpose and value, yet all have sinned and fallen short of His glory. Because of sin, we are spiritually separated from God and incapable of saving ourselves through effort, morality, or good works. (Genesis 1:27; Romans 3:23; Romans 5:12)</p>

    <p><strong>About Salvation</strong> We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone—not by works. Through His substitutionary death and shed blood, our sins are forgiven. Through His bodily resurrection, we are justified and given new life. Salvation is a free gift from God to all who repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:23–26; Romans 5:8–9; John 3:16)</p>

    <p><strong>About Jesus Christ</strong> Jesus Christ is eternally God, the second Person of the Trinity. All things were created through Him and for Him. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for the sins of humanity, rose bodily from the dead, and ascended into Heaven where He intercedes for believers. He will one day return—first to gather His Church, and later to judge and reign forever in righteousness. (John 1:1–3; Philippians 2:5–11; Luke 1:34–35; Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4; Revelation 19:11–16)</p>
