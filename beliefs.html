  <h1>What I Believe</h1>

  <main>
    <!-- (All your belief paragraphs stay exactly as before) -->
    <p><strong>About God</strong> I believe in one true God, eternally existent in three Persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit—equal in power, glory, and essence. God is the Creator of all things, having spoken creation into existence from nothing. His sovereignty, holiness, and love reveal His character and purpose. (Genesis 1:1; Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19)</p>

    <p><strong>About the Bible</strong> The Bible is God’s inspired and authoritative Word—perfect, infallible, and complete. It is the foundation for faith, doctrine, and life. Through Scripture, God reveals His will, His plan of redemption, and His character. The Word of God takes precedence over any earthly law or authority that contradicts its truth. (2 Timothy 3:16–17; Psalm 119:105; Hebrews 4:12)</p>

    <p><strong>About the Holy Spirit</strong> The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the triune Godhead—equal with the Father and the Son. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment; indwells believers at salvation; and empowers them to live in holiness and serve God faithfully. He distributes spiritual gifts according to His will. The truest evidence of His presence is love expressed in action. All spiritual gifts remain active in the Church today and must be exercised with balance and biblical order. (John 14:16–17; John 16:8; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:4–11; Galatians 5:22–23)</p>

    <p><strong>About Mankind</strong> Humanity was created in God’s image with purpose and value, yet all have sinned and fallen short of His glory. Because of sin, we are spiritually separated from God and incapable of saving ourselves through effort, morality, or good works. (Genesis 1:27; Romans 3:23; Romans 5:12)</p>

    <p><strong>About Salvation</strong> We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone—not by works. Through His substitutionary death and shed blood, our sins are forgiven. Through His bodily resurrection, we are justified and given new life. Salvation is a free gift from God to all who repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 3:23–26; Romans 5:8–9; John 3:16)</p>

    <p><strong>About Jesus Christ</strong> Jesus Christ is eternally God, the second Person of the Trinity. All things were created through Him and for Him. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died on the cross for the sins of humanity, rose bodily from the dead, and ascended into Heaven where He intercedes for believers. He will one day return—first to gather His Church, and later to judge and reign forever in righteousness. (John 1:1–3; Philippians 2:5–11; Luke 1:34–35; Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3–4; Revelation 19:11–16)</p>

    <p><strong>About the Church</strong> The Church is the body of Christ, composed of all believers throughout the world. Its mission is to know, love, and glorify God, and to make Him known through evangelism, discipleship, and service. Christ Himself appoints apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip believers for the work of ministry. The Church is called to gather regularly for teaching, fellowship, prayer, communion, and worship. (Matthew 16:18; Acts 2:42–47; Ephesians 4:11–13; Hebrews 10:25)</p>

    <p><strong>About Human Life</strong> All human life is sacred, created by God in His image and worthy of protection—from conception to natural death. Every person, regardless of age, ability, or condition, has immeasurable worth. We are called to honor and defend life as a reflection of God’s creative purpose. (Psalm 139:13–16; Jeremiah 1:5; Genesis 9:6)</p>

    <p><strong>About Gender</strong> God created mankind as male and female, a distinction that is biological, not psychological or social. What modern culture calls “gender” is a human invention and does not appear in Scripture. Science affirms what the Bible declares—that sex is determined by God and imprinted in our DNA, not assigned or self-defined. Each person is created intentionally and immutably as either male or female, both bearing the image of God and equal in value and dignity. (Genesis 1:27; Matthew 19:4; Psalm 139:13–16)</p>

    <p><strong>About Marriage</strong> Marriage is a sacred covenant established by God between one man and one woman for life, reflecting the love and unity between Christ and His Church. Within this covenant, sexual intimacy is a holy and purposeful act designed for love, faithfulness, and the continuation of life. (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6; Ephesians 5:31–33)</p>

    <p><strong>About Sexuality</strong> God’s design for sexual intimacy is to be expressed only within the covenant of marriage as defined by Scripture. Any sexual activity outside this design—including adultery, fornication, homosexual behavior, and all forms of sexual immorality—is sin and falls short of God’s standard. However, the gospel offers forgiveness and transformation to all who repent and believe. No sin is beyond God’s grace; through faith in Jesus Christ, anyone can be made new and walk in holiness by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11; Hebrews 13:4; 2 Corinthians 5:17; John 8:11)</p>

    <p><strong>About Christ’s Return and Eternity</strong> Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead and to reign forever in righteousness. There will be a bodily resurrection of all people—those who belong to Him will enter eternal life, and those who reject Him will face eternal separation from God. (Daniel 12:2; John 5:28–29; Revelation 20–21)</p>
