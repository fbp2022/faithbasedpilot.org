  <h1>What I Believe</h1>

  <main>
    <p><strong>About God</strong> - Regarding God, I firmly believe in the existence of one true God who exists eternally in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Their equality in power and glory is unquestionable. God's act of creating everything from nothing merely by speaking is a testament to His divine authority and creative prowess.</p>

    <p><strong>About the Bible</strong> - In terms of the Bible, I hold it in the highest regard as God's direct communication to humanity. It stands as an unparalleled love story and the most remarkable rescue mission in the accounts of the universe. Its perfection and infallibility are absolute. The Word of God serves as the bedrock guiding our actions. Moreover, I firmly assert that the Word of God holds precedence over any earthly law that contradicts its teachings.</p>

    <p><strong>About the Holy Spirit</strong> – The Holy Spirit, I believe He is a distinct person within the triune Godhead, equal in importance alongside the Father and the Son. His presence is actively felt in our world, guiding individuals by revealing truths about sin, righteousness, and judgment. Upon embracing faith, the Holy Spirit dwells within believers, empowering them for their life’s purpose and service. Bestowing spiritual gifts according to His discretion and timing, He remains the source of these divine abilities. I am convinced that the primary manifestation of being filled with the Holy Spirit is reflected in one's genuine love for others. Furthermore, I affirm that the spiritual gifts remain relevant within the body of Christ today. However, I emphasize their responsible use, in alignment with God's teachings, maintaining balance and order as prescribed in His word.</p>

    <p><strong>About mankind</strong> – Regarding humanity, it's an intrinsic part of our nature to fall short of God's perfect standard due to our inherent sinfulness. Despite our efforts, be it through hard work, charity, or moral deeds, we are incapable of saving ourselves. Everyone has experienced sin, yet through Christ, we are transformed into renewed beings.</p>

    <p><strong>About Jesus</strong> – Jesus stands as the eternal essence of God—fully divine, inseparable from God the Father and God the Spirit within the triune Godhead. His existence spans eternity without a beginning or end. All creation stems from Him, shaped through Him, and dedicated to Him. Born of a virgin in humble surroundings, He lived a life devoid of sin and sacrificed Himself, carrying the weight of humanity's transgressions. Through His voluntary sacrifice, He conquered sin and transcended death by rising from the grave. Ascending to Heaven, He prepares an everlasting dwelling for those who believe in Him. His imminent return awaits—first, to gather His followers, and later, to pass judgment and defeat Satan, heralding an ultimate triumph.</p>

    <p><strong>About the church</strong> – I believe in the singular church, guided by Jesus Himself. The purpose of this ministry is to intimately know, adore, and bring glory to God while spreading His message to the world. Within this community, Jesus appoints apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors/teachers to empower the believers for their ministry. Gathering regularly for Bible study, fellowship, communion, and prayers is a directive for the body of Christ. Additionally, a fundamental command is to spread the teachings of Christ worldwide, baptizing individuals and instructing them to follow God's complete guidance.</p>

    <p><strong>About human life</strong> – The sanctity of human life is deeply rooted in the belief that every individual is sacred, created by God in His own image. This inherent worth extends across all phases of life, from the earliest stages in the womb to the elderly, the differently abled, and every condition in between until natural passing. Our solemn duty is to safeguard, cherish, and honor every aspect of human life, as guided by passages like Psalm 139:16-14 and Jeremiah 1:5."</p>
