          <!-- <img class="thumb" src="images/the-strength-of-a-servant-killing-pride-and-leading-low.jpg" alt=""> -->
  <p>Let’s be honest. Serving is easy when it’s public, when people see it, and when we get praise or affirmation. But true servanthood begins where pride dies. And for most of us, pride doesn’t die quietly. It has to be crucified.</p>

    <p>This is where most people get stuck. We’ll serve, but only if we still feel respected. We’ll help only if it doesn’t make us look small. We’ll volunteer, but not if it costs us control. But Christ didn’t call us to manage appearances. He called us to follow His example.</p>

    <p><em>“Have this way of thinking in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although existing in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, by taking the form of a slave, by being made in the likeness of men.”</em> (<strong>Philippians 2:5–7, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>He emptied Himself. He chose the position of the lowest. He washed the feet of the men who would abandon Him — Peter, who denied Him, and Judas, who betrayed Him.</p>

    <p><em>“You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’; and you are right, for so I am. If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.”</em> (<strong>John 13:13–14, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>That’s not a metaphor. That’s a command. The King of Kings picked up a basin and a towel. What excuse do we have?</p>

    <p>Servanthood is not optional. It is obedience. But it can’t just be outward. It has to be inward. Because there is a kind of service that still protects pride: the kind that serves to be seen, the type that gives to feel important, the kind that hides ego behind effort. That is not Christlike. That is self-righteousness.</p>

    <p>What does authentic servanthood look like? <em>“Do nothing from selfish ambition or vain glory, but with humility of mind regarding one another as more important than yourselves.”</em> (<strong>Philippians 2:3, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>Not equal. More important. That’s the line most men won’t cross because it means putting others above your desires, schedule, name, and will. Jesus didn’t just do acts of service. He became a servant. And now we are called to walk that same path. But you cannot walk it carrying pride. You cannot wash feet while trying to look impressive. You cannot bend low if you are obsessed with standing tall.</p>

    <p><em>“Whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave. Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”</em> (<strong>Matthew 20:26–28, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>Jesus didn’t just serve. He gave up His life. That is the cost of following Him. That is the model of manhood we are called to. So what are you still holding onto? Your status? Your comfort? Your name? If we are going to follow Christ, then pride must die. And in its place rises something the world cannot explain: a man who leads by serving, who is strong enough to be low, who does not need credit because his life belongs to Someone greater.</p>

    <p>This is not soft Christianity. This is Christlikeness. And it is time we return to it.</p>

    <p>When pride dies, something more substantial takes its place: responsibility. Not the kind that demands attention, but the kind that shows up regardless of who notices. That’s the heart of Biblical leadership — not control, not applause, just obedience. Jesus didn’t just say “serve.” He showed us how to lead from below.</p>

    <p><em>“If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.”</em> (<strong>John 13:14, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>The Lord and Teacher stooped. The King of the universe bent His knees and touched the dirtiest parts of His followers. That was leadership. That was strength. Men today chase influence. Jesus chased obedience. He didn’t fight for a seat at the table — He prepared the table, served the bread, and carried the cross.</p>

    <p>So what does this look like for us? In your home, it means leading your family by example — not barking orders or demanding respect, but washing their feet metaphorically daily. You don’t lead your wife by dominating her; you lead by loving her as Christ loved the church — by sacrificing for her (<strong>Ephesians 5:25</strong>). You don’t raise your children with fear and frustration; you raise them with patience, correction, and constant prayer (<strong>Ephesians 6:4</strong>). You don’t make your home your throne. You make it your altar.</p>

    <p>In your church, it means not waiting to be handed a microphone. It means showing up early, staying late, picking up the trash, and praying when no one sees. In your community, it means choosing integrity when it costs you something. It means being the same man in public that you are in private. It means stepping up when others sit back. That is not weakness. That is war against the flesh.</p>

    <p>And here’s the truth most won’t admit: being a servant is costly. You will be overlooked. You will be underappreciated. You will feel unseen. And that’s precisely where God wants to shape you. Because the more hidden you are from the world, the more usable you are to Him.</p>

    <p><em>“So, when you do what you are commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have done only that which we ought to have done.’”</em> (<strong>Luke 17:10, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>You aren’t owed recognition. You owe your life to the One who bought it. So lead. Lead by kneeling. Lead by dying to pride. Lead by going last. Lead by taking hits for others and not needing credit. That is Biblical manhood. It doesn’t demand — it serves. It doesn’t self-promote — it self-denies. It doesn’t point fingers — it bears burdens. That is the strength of a servant. That is the leadership the world cannot copy. That is the image of Christ in you. And if you are willing to go low, God will do something great through your obedience.</p>

             <p>I’ve been thinking about how our culture has shaped the way we understand the words <strong>servant</strong> and <strong>slave</strong>, and how that can actually distort how we read Scripture.</p>

    <p>In today’s Western world, a servant is someone who chooses to help. Maybe they get paid, maybe they’re doing a good deed, but either way, they retain control. They can clock out. They can quit. They give, but they still belong to themselves.</p>

    <p>When we hear slave, our minds go straight to American history—forced labor, abuse, ownership without dignity. That history is real, and it’s brutal. But it’s not the framework Scripture is using when it calls us <em>slaves of Christ</em>.</p>

    <p>Biblically, the word most often used by Jesus and the apostles is <em>doulos</em> — <strong>slave</strong>. Not servant. Not helper. Slave. And not in the American sense of racial abuse, but in the Greco-Roman sense of total ownership, loyalty, and lifelong commitment. A <em>doulos</em> had no personal rights. They existed for the will of their master.</p>

    <p>Now, let’s talk about the difference between being a servant of Christ versus being His slave.</p>

    <p>A servant might help God’s cause. They might volunteer, show up to church, pray when it’s convenient. But at the end of the day, they still keep part of their life for themselves. They choose when and how to serve.</p>

    <p>A slave of Christ doesn’t get that luxury. A slave doesn’t bargain. A slave doesn’t say “I’ll give You Sunday, but not my relationships.” A slave is owned. Fully. Completely. And here’s the crazy part — Christ is the only Master who doesn’t exploit, but restores. The only One who gives freedom through surrender.</p>

    <p>Becoming a slave to Christ isn’t easy. No one said it would be. Denying your flesh is one of the hardest things you’ll ever do. This world tells you to chase your desires, but Christ calls you to crucify them.</p>

    <p>Still, turning yourself over to Christ completely is what we’re called to do. Look at Paul. He used to be Saul, the persecutor of Christians. But when he gave his life to Christ, even his name changed.</p>

    <p><strong>Paul</strong> comes from the Latin <em>Paulus</em>, meaning “small” or “humble.” That wasn’t just a name change—it was a posture shift. From pride to humility. From power to submission. From Saul the self-driven to Paul the Christ-owned.</p>

    <p>This is where I stand:</p>

    <p>I don’t want to just serve Christ.<br>
    I want to belong to Him.<br>
    I want to be a slave to Christ.<br>
    Because in that slavery—unlike anything this world has ever known—there is peace, purpose, and life.</p>

         <p><em>May 24, 2025 – A preview of a full paper currently being written.</em></p>

    <p>This short post introduces a concept I’m actively developing into a full-length paper. That upcoming study will go deeper into what happened when God created Eve from Adam, how that moment divided the fullness of humanity into two parts, and how marriage was designed to bring them back together. What you’re about to read is the foundation.</p>

    <p>I’ve been reflecting on the moment in Genesis when God created Eve. He didn’t form her from the dust like He did with Adam. And unlike Adam, God did not breathe the breath of life directly into her. Instead, He caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep, took something from his side, and formed a woman. That moment wasn’t just about the creation of Eve. It was about the separation of something whole.</p>

    <p>Adam originally held within himself what God had designed in full humanity — the strength and the sensitivity, the reason and the emotion, the masculine and the feminine. But when God created Eve, He removed part of Adam to place it into another. And He did it for a purpose: reunion.</p>

    <p><em>“So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. Then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. And Yahweh God fashioned the rib which He had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man.”</em> (<strong>Genesis 2:21–22, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>At that moment, man was no longer whole and on his own. What had been in him was now beside him. The capacity for emotion, relational depth, and nurturing care was removed and embodied in the woman. And this was not a flaw. It was intentional. God did not make man incomplete by mistake. He made man incomplete by design so that the reunion between man and woman would carry deep spiritual meaning.</p>

    <p>This is why marriage is sacred. It is not just about companionship. It is about restoration. It is about two becoming one again.</p>

    <p><em>“For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and cleave to his wife. And they shall become one flesh.”</em> (<strong>Genesis 2:24, LSB</strong>)</p>

    <p>The world has lost sight of this truth. It tells men to embrace only emotion or to suppress it entirely. It tells women to become their own authority, to carry the burdens of both roles. The result is confusion, distortion, and disconnection from God’s original design. But when we look back to Eden, we see the clarity. We know the pattern. Man and woman were meant to reflect different aspects of God's image and reunite in covenant.</p>

    <p>Masculinity is not about oppression. Femininity is not about weakness. Each holds a distinct piece of God's reflection. Marriage is where they meet again. It is where strength finds grace. Where leadership meets compassion. Where one flesh becomes more than biology — it becomes testimony.</p>

    <p>This post is only the beginning. A full paper is coming soon, where I will explore how this design shapes identity, relationships, and the roles we were created to fulfill. What God separated in the garden, He now calls to be united in covenant — not just for companionship, but to mirror His glory.</p>

    <p><strong>We were separated for a reason.<br>
    We are reunited for a purpose.</strong></p>
